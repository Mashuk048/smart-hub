# Smart Hub Device

## Overview

The Smart Hub Device is an innovative solution that receives RF signal data from an RF sensor and connects to a Wi-Fi network via an ESP8266 module. The hub processes the received data and sends it to an MQTT broker for real-time monitoring and control.

## Features

- **RF Signal Reception**: Captures data from RF sensors.
- **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module**: Provides connectivity to a Wi-Fi network.
- **MQTT Protocol**: Transmits data to a lightweight MQTT broker for easy access and management.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Allows for instant updates and notifications based on RF sensor data.

## Hardware Required

- RF Sensor (compatible with your RF signal type)
- ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, NodeMCU)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply (5V for ESP8266)
- (Optional) MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto)

## Software Required

- Arduino IDE (or any compatible IDE)
- Libraries:
  - PubSubClient (for MQTT communication)
  - ESP8266WiFi (for Wi-Fi connectivity)
  - RF module library (depending on your RF sensor)

## Installation

1. **Wiring the Hardware**:
   - Connect the RF sensor to the microcontroller and the ESP8266 according to the sensor's datasheet.
   - Ensure that power connections are secure and the ESP8266 is powered.

2. **Setting Up the Software**:
   - Install the Arduino IDE.
   - Add the ESP8266 board manager.
   - Install the required libraries through the Library Manager.

3. **Configuring the Code**:
   - Clone this repository or download the source code.
   - Update the `config.h` file with your Wi-Fi credentials and MQTT broker details.
   - Upload the code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, the Smart Hub Device will start receiving RF signal data and forwarding it to the specified MQTT broker. You can subscribe to relevant topics to monitor the RF signals in real-time.

## MQTT Topics

- **RF Signal Data**: `/rf/signal`
- **Status Updates**: `/rf/status`
